// challanges faced

during creating this portal I have faced several challanges such as chat implementation, because this is the first time I have to implement this functionality 


// my development approach : 


- I have stated by making login and registration page using html css js and use mysql and php for backend and db purpose which stores the user data and use that data when the user is logged in again 

- after successfully implementation of this I have started with the home page design, this is also done with the help of html css where i have created static card design with a button name contact which redirect user to the chat app page 

// future work : 

 There are lots of thing we can implement in this web app such as 
 
 -Login using social media and google,
 -Use websocket.io for real time chat implementation, 
 -Major changes in UI by implementing dark mode and also use different themes to make the user experience more user friendly, 
 -Create a feedback form where the user can report the bug and also send the feedback to admin
